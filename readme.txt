In this reposatoray we try to explore the internals of redux,by creating our own version of redux

We will be creating the following 
1)Store
2)Reducer

Sample app->To do app,providing functions for adding,toggeling,deleting a todo.


Reducer->It is a pure function which takes previous state and returns new state



connect->A function which wires redux and react,providing mapDispatchToProps and mapStateToProps.
- It is a kind of wrapper which provides functions avaliabe in props,and it talk to redux.
